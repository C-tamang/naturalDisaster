# naturalDisaster Database
I worked with a team to design a database that tracks significant earthquakes and tsunamis worldwide. We built the database using existing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We created a database that tracks these natural disasters to understand these destructive forces better.

## Data
We used the data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). However, we only used a subset of the dataset due to the project's scope.
